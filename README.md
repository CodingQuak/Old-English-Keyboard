# Old English Keyboard

Currently for Windows only. A keyboard layout for typing characters used in Old English that are not used in Modern English. Many people use the Icelandic keyboard layout for Old English, but I found the characters were in unintuitive places for me. 

This layout was made using the [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339). If you would like to modify the layout to suit your needs, you can download MKLC and edit the oe-keyboard.klc file.s

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository (the green button in the upper right).
2. Run setup.exe in the build folder.
3. Restart your computer.
4. Activate the keyboard layout as you would any other (through language settings or keyboard settings depending on your OS. Google is your friend!)
